### Hi my name is XiÃ¡n Garcia Nogueira ðŸ‘‹

I am currently finishing my Degree in Computer Engineering, missing the TFG and external internships to finish. I am looking for a job to expand my knowledge and finish my degree in the meantime. I love programming in C ++, but I have a great facility to adapt to any tool or language, given my educational experience in which I have handled many of them. I have total availability to move and motivation to start my work experience as a programmer.
