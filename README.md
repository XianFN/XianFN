### Hi my name is XiÃ¡n Garcia Nogueira ðŸ‘‹

I am about to graduate in Computer Engineering, with only my Final Project outstanding
and an optional subject to finish in December 2021. My main career goal is to learn from
the experience of working in a robust and innovative company along with its staff.
The knowledge acquired in my training does not fully reflect my ambition to work with
new technologies, therefore, I am completely open to moving to any country, as I have
done for the ERASMUS + program. In doing so, I am used to looking into the most
cutting-edge alternatives in the computer market at an international level.
I consider myself a motivated and curious person. My greatest strengths are adaptability as
problem solving in an effective and swift way, development of new ideas, excellent
cooperation and extensive teamwork skills.
Growing professionally in a competitive company is my main goal. I would ideally like to
work in an organisation that embraces my creativity while challenging and expanding my
knowledge.
